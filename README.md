# GUI_for_ParsingCombinations
It's a GUI built to resolve a specific problem: scanning among all the possible combinations of a list of numbers and pick up one combination (if exists) that sum up a given target

It can be used as a way to point out which invoices have been paid.
Trivial example:
Invoices  Value
a         10
b         12
c         -8
d         6
e         16
f         3

Payment Received: 11

The app returns:
Invoice Value
c       -8
e       16
f       3
Total   **11**
